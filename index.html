    <h1>Fair Trade — Study Sheet (Simple English)</h1>
    <p class="intro"><strong>Yes.</strong> This sheet answers the five questions you listed. Read the numbered sections below. Each section uses short bullet points for easy learning.</p>

    <h2>1. Description — What is this type of aid?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fair Trade is a market-based form of development aid.</li>
      <li>It uses labels and rules to make trade fairer for producers.</li>
      <li>Key parts: a minimum price, a social premium, and certification rules.</li>
      <li>Who gives it? Certification groups, ethical companies, NGOs, and consumers who buy fair products.</li>
      <li>Who is the addressee? Small farmers, worker groups, and cooperatives in poor countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Advantages — What are the benefits?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher and more stable income for certified producers (minimum price).</li>
      <li>Social premium money for community projects (schools, health, water).</li>
      <li>Better working conditions and rules against child labor.</li>
      <li>Encourages better farming methods and some environmental care.</li>
      <li>Compared to direct aid: it links to markets and can be more lasting.</li>
      <li>Who profits? Producers, their communities, and consumers who want ethical goods.</li>
      <li>Positive effects: more money, local projects, stronger cooperatives, some job security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disadvantages / Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Certification costs and paperwork can be too hard for the poorest farmers.</li>
      <li>Fair Trade is often a small niche market — not all products sell as fair trade.</li>
      <li>Benefits do not always reach every family in a community (unequal distribution).</li>
      <li>Risk of dependency on a few buyers or on export markets.</li>
      <li>Some studies show mixed long-term effects — not always clear improvement for all.</li>
      <li>Processes hampered: local smallholders may be left out; local markets can stay weak.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Example — One short case</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: A coffee cooperative gets Fair Trade certification.</li>
      <li>Advantages shown: they get a minimum price when world prices fall; they use the premium to build a school and buy a coffee dryer.</li>
      <li>Problems shown: very small farms could not pay certification fees and stayed outside; some families did not get extra money.</li>
      <li>Lesson: Fair Trade helps groups, but extra help (training, subsidies) is needed for the poorest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Conclusion & Recommendation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Short answer: Fair Trade is useful and should continue, but with conditions.</li>
      <li>It is more sustainable when combined with training, market access, and help to pay certification costs.</li>
      <li>Do not rely on Fair Trade alone — add public programs and local development support.</li>
      <li>Conditions for success: strong cooperatives, transparent use of premiums, support for the poorest, and market development.</li>
      <li>Final note: Fair Trade can be part of long-term development if it is fair, inclusive, and supported by other measures.</li>
    </ul>
